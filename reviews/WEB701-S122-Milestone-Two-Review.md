## Milestone Two Review

The second phase of this project was the evaluation phase. This required me to describe the purpose of web frameworks and identify common framework features and indicate those used in this website development scenario. I also needed to create a Work Grid to evaluate two web framework systems I proposed for use in my project. Each framework was to be evaluated as described including screenshots that demonstrate prototype solutions that meet website requirements. The goal of this work grid was to demonstrate how the requirements would be met by each framework, including login and registration, account administration, product registration, and token acceptance. I was then to conclude the report with a recommendation of a web framework to use in the development of
this website as well  as the framework I will be using for development of my website. 

This phase of development was much more time consuming than that of the design phase as I needed to learn a framework that I had not previous experience with. This was important as is broadened my knowledge and experience and gave me a possible option for my chosen framework. I had prior experience with React which made it easy to develop the prototype, whereas I had no experience with the Angular framework. Although it is unlikely that a business would build a functioning prototype in multiple frameworks with the purpose of comparing which one would be best for their implementation, this was a useful phase in understand what features of a framework make it better for a given task.

I decided that I would choose React as one of my frameworks as I had prior knowledge of it. I could have chosen a completely different framework so that I had even more experience with different frameworks, but I believe that comparing something new to something I already know provides me with knowledge as to what is potentially an better alternative to what I already know. Although the satisfaction, interest, and usage of Angular is going down, It was suggested to me that I should learn it. I decided that I would use this milestone as an opportunity to learn it.

After creating the two working applications and analysing the two frameworks and the processes involved, I came to the conclusion that for someone who is new to using front end JavaScript frameworks, React is the better option as it has a lower learning curve, and there is less complexity to the file structure. I recommended that if you were to use the React framework, that you write it in TypeScript rather than Vanilla JavaScript as this will likely make error handling and prevention much better. I said that the complexity of the work that I undertook was quite high, and I was able to achieve the goals that I set out to achieve. As mentioned prior, there were several tasks required for our application to perform and I believe that all of these tasks were met.

Overall, it is unlikely that I would use Angular again as I found that the file structure was complex and bloated, and the language was too complex and verbose for my liking.
