## Milestone Three Review

The third and final phase of this assignment was the develop phase. This required me to implement my website using my chosen framework and research and write a report about a technology of my interest that I would implement in my website. The website was to implement the functional requirements as produced in milestone two, as well as ensuring that the code was of excellent quality, all features working, and the majority of the submitted code being my own.

This phase of development was not as time consuming as that of the evaluate phase as I only really needed to focus on front end design. I made a few changes to the backend including some authentication and validation. However, most of my efforts were in the front end design. The hardest part of this milestone was designing the landing page. My initial design was nice, but after starting the development, I was not satisfied with it. I wanted to make a website that looked more like a charity than a ecommerce store as that is its primary purpose. After a few redesigns, I came up with my final design and am much happier with how it came out. Once I figured out how to implement this design, It made things far more easier for improving the other pages designs.

I initially was using a lot of bootstrap to help me with my design, however, I found that I could achieve much more without it. I still used some for the sake of grid layouts, but this still required me to write the code for it. The thing I struggled most with was the media statements in the CSS. This is what is used for making your website responsive. As I was working on a larger monitor, It made it hard getting proportions correctly as viewing the same website on my laptop often looked significantly different. After time, I managed get enough done that the website looks good both on mobile devices as well as desktop PCs.

Of the development phases, this was my favorite one as I could express my interest in designing websites. I prefer the visual design and UX, rather than the server side development. I enjoy planning out page designs and learning new ways of implementing components. Throughout the development of my website, I have learned a lot of new things such as animation, modal boxes, and parallax. Unfortunately, I didn't know that React has a library for the parallax effect and I ended up coding it myself. However, this was a pretty easy task and I would likely just code it myself again in the future.

Overall, I believe that this milestone was great for my learning as a software developer as there were a lot of new things that I learned throughout the process. Likewise, with the project as a whole, there were a lot of new skills that I learned and improvements made to things I already knew.
