## Milestone One Review

The first phase of this project was the design phase. This required me to investigate and produce a wide range of information that would help in further development of my website. This involved such things as goals, user experience, site content, and visual design. This is a very important phase of development as it provides a basis of what the purpose of our website is, who will use it, what it will do, and how it will look. Although the physical implementation phase is often a difficult phase, this one is generally the more important phase as we need to know things such as whether the website is needed, what problem it will solve, and the feasibility.

The first, and probably most time consuming task, was identifying the site goals. This involved stating our mission, the goals of the site, the intended audience(s), why it will be used, and how it will be promoted. I found this to be quite time consuming as I had to decide what it was that my website was going to be used for, and why it was needed. This is important as it is pointless embarking on the development of a product if nobody will use it or there is already many of the products that already exists. Once I identified the what the site was going to be used for, I then decided on the short and long term goals. These goals would help me in the future as they act as my non-functional requirements. The short term goals give me an idea of what I hope to achieve within the project timeframe, while the long term goals are what would hopefully be achieved if the website was actually implemented fully.

The next task was to identify the benefits of knowing your target audience, creating scenarios, and performing a competitive analysis. Scenarios are useful for future tasks as it helps us get an idea of who might use the website, and what they might want to achieve. From these scenarios, we can then plan out how we will achieve the tasks involved. A competitive analysis helps us identify what is already exists on the market. From this, we can gain an understanding on what our competitors are doing that is working, what we can do to stand out from the others, and design choices they have made to improve such things as usability, accessibility, and desirability. This helps us in the future when it comes to designing features of our website as we can fix mistakes that they may have made, or use ideas that look and perform to how we would like ours to.

The next stage involved one of, in my opinion, the most important parts of the project development, identifying the functional requirements. This task gives me the foundation to work off of when I start to implement the physical application. As I develop the website, I can go through these requirements and tick them off as I go to ensure that the website performs every task that is required. This is very useful as I don't need to think about these things as I go. In saying this, the functional requirements may be added to or changed depending on limitations or improvement of usability.

Designing the site structure helps me understand how the routes are going to be set up when it comes to developing the front and backend. It gives me a blueprint of how the site will be laid out. This is very useful as I can identify key elements that I might be missing, and know what pages I need to make for their given purpose. The visual design of the pages is also useful as it gives me a general idea of what the pages will look like. These designs should ensure that all of the functional requirements are met. In saying this, It is likely that these designs will change during development as new ideas may arise, or original plans may not prove to be feasible.

Up there with the importance of design is the CRUD analysis. This task involves taking those functional requirements, and planning out what tables are needed in our database as well as how our application will interact with the database to ensure that the requirements are met. This is very useful when it comes to developing my API as I can use this as a reference when creating each of the required methods.

Overall this milestone is crucial in the development of my project, and the things that I have learned and implemented will help me a lot in future tasks to come.
